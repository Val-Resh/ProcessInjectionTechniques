# MITRE ATT&CK Process Injection
This project aims to cover the majority of Window's based process injection techniques. The purpose of this project is to learn how these techniques work programmatically to develop a deeper understanding. The project does not attempt to bypass EDRs, instead it provides the foundations to understand the differences between the different types of process injection.
