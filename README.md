# MITRE ATT&CK Process Injection
This project aims to cover the majority of Window's based process injection techniques. The purpose of this project is to learn how these techniques work programmatically to develop a deeper understanding. The project does not attempt to bypass EDRs, instead it provides the foundations to understand the differences between the different types of process injection.

## Project Status:
- Portable Executable Injection (COMPLETED)
- Thread Execution Hijacking (TODO)
- Asynchronous Procedure Call (TODO)
- Thread Local Storage (TODO)
- Extra Window Memory Injection (TODO)
- Process Hollowing (TODO)
- Process Doppelg√§nging (TODO)
- ListPlanting (TODO)

## Usage:
The payload to inject into a process must be placed within the main function's variable `shellcode` before compilation.
Ensure the files are compiled to the correct bit architecture. 
The current state of the project does not include any commandline arguments, so running the executable does not require any arguments. In the future when additional injection techniques are added, I will include an arguement to specify which technique to use.
